# Login App Authentication.

This's a project created to practice using NodeJS with the framework Express for the controller server, database MongoDB, control of session with express-session, authentication with Passport and view engine EJS.

This exercise was taken from Fazt's YouTube channel, which I recommend [Fazt Code](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMn28O1sQGochG94HdlthbA).

I liked it and I learned a lot with this practice.
